## Calories & Macronutrients Tracker

This application helps **record** and **track** daily calories and macronutrients intake.

The application allows users to input their daily goals as well as intakes, 
and informs the user whether they have met their **daily goals**. 

*Macronutrients* include:
- Carbohydrates
- Proteins
- Fats

Calories and macronutrients are **central to health and fitness**. 
Whether your personal fitness goals are to lose weight, gain weight, build muscle, or lean down, 
this calories & macronutrients tracking application can be helpful in meeting those goals. 

This project of building a fitness-related app was of interest to me as I had previously 
been tracking my macronutrients along with having a rigorous strength-training routine. After couple years of tracking 
my food intake, I became familiar with the appropriate intake for myself and paused tracking. 

However, now having no access to public gyms and different fitness goals, I thought a calories & macronutrients 
tracking application where I can add needed functionalities as I see fit would not only be interesting, but helpful to improving
my health and wellness.
